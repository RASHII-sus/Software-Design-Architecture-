# SDA-Pro Integration Platform

SDA-Pro is an integrated Security Detection and Automated Response demo. The workspace now keeps each student-owned subsystem intact under `modules/`, with shared operational scripts at the root and in `scripts/`.

## Services

| Service | Port | Location |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| SOC Dashboard Frontend | `3000` | `modules/student-c/frontend` |
| SOC Platform Backend | `8084` | `modules/student-c` |
| Alert Ingestion | `8081` | `modules/student-a/services/alert-ingestion-service` |
| Enrichment and Correlation | `8082` | `modules/student-a/services/enrichment-correlation-service` |
| Incident Management | `8083` | `modules/student-a/services/incident-management-service` |
| Threat Intel Adapter | `3002` | `modules/student-b/services/threat-intel-service` |
| Response Orchestrator | `3003` | `modules/student-b/services/response-orchestration-service` |
| Notification Dispatch | `3004` | `modules/student-b/services/notification-service` |
| Middleware Pipeline | `3005` | `modules/student-b/middleware` |

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Docker Desktop
- Java 17
- Node.js 18+
- PowerShell

From the repository root:

```powershell
.\run-all.ps1
```

Pick option `1` to start the full platform, or option `6` to run health checks.

The launcher resolves paths relative to this repository, so it no longer depends on a fixed drive such as `S:\Sem-Project`.

Docker Compose full-stack startup:

```powershell
docker compose up -d --build
.\scripts\integration-smoke.ps1 -InjectSampleAlert
```

With `make` available:

```bash
make up
make smoke
make populate
make down
```

## Demo Data

After the services are running:

```powershell
.\populate-data.ps1
```

This injects sample Splunk and CrowdStrike alerts, creates incidents, moves incidents through legal state transitions, and posts dashboard-facing alerts into the SOC backend.

## Subsystem Notes

Student A remains a Maven multi-module Spring Boot project with local SQLite databases and pattern-focused services.

Student B remains a NestJS service suite with Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, shared contracts, and Docker Compose infrastructure.

Student C remains the SOC platform backend plus the React dashboard. The frontend now uses Vite so the existing proxy configuration in `modules/student-c/frontend/vite.config.js` is active during local development.
